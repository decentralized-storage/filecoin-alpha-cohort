# Keypo Introduction

Keypo is the easiest way to add end-to-end encrypted access control to your app, with support for any data-type and EVM wallet. We handle encryption, key management, and access control so you can focus on building privacy-first apps:

## Key Features

- Decryption keys are stored in a distributed key management network and never touch your app.
- Access control logic lives on-chain, owned and defined by the data owner.
- Encrypted data is stored on IPFS and accessible from any gateway.
- The SDK is gasless and works with embedded wallets like Privy, including email-based sign-ins.
- Trusted execution environments (TEEs) enable advanced access controls, like private compute by authorized programs.

## Getting Started
